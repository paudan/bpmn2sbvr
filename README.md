# bpmn2sbvr
Repository for experimental code for extracting SBVR rules from BPMN models

### Running the code

The experiments are implemented as Java tests. To run them, one would need existing MagicDraw and IntelliJ installation (MagicDraw 19.0). 
Note that one may need to adjust library settings
